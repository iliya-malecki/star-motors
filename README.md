# star-motors
This is an open-source robotic telesope conversion, it consists of:
  1. 3d-printed gears, brackets and other madoodas to hold everything in place
  2. electronics to spin the telescope around (Arduino MEGA, 5 stepper motors, 2 encoders and a metric ton of wiring)
  3. (non-existent yet) electronics for decision-making, i.e. tracking stars and pinpointing coordinates (i.e. a Raspberry PI)
  4. lower level arduino code for stepping, manual movement input with encoders and (non-existent yet) position tracking
  5. (non-existent yet) higher level python code for tracking, photo/video processing and targeting wanted coordinates
Someone please rewrite this readme once we are ready to go with most of the features and this readme becomes actually useful for others and not only us
